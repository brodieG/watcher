## Overview

A mechanism to record function state during evaluation for later analysis.
Variable values and meta data are recorded for each 'top-level' call.  Top-level
calls are, roughly speaking, distinct R expressions that are visible directly in
the source of the R function.

This is package is experimental, rough around the edges, and not currently
intended for CRAN publication.  It has no tests, and was built with
expediency rather than robustness as the guiding principle.  The API may change
completely in future iterations if there are any.  More likely there will be no
future updates to the project, except in the unlikely case it garners
substantial interest from others.
