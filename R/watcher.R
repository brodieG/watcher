#' Record Function State During Evaluation
#'
#' A mechanism to record function state during evaluation for later
#' analysis. Variable values and meta data are recorded for each
#' ‘top-level’ call.
#'
#' This is package is experimental and rough around the edges, and was
#' built with expediency rather than robustness as the guiding principle.
#' The API may change completely in future iterations if there are any.
#' More likely there will be no future updates to the project, except in
#' the unlikely case it garners substantial attention.
#'
#' See `vignette('watcher', package='watcher')` for more details.
